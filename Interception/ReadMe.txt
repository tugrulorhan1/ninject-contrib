This project adds some support for the runtime registration of interceptors
as well as some .NET 3.5 extensions to make it easier to register
methods/properties for interception.

... more to come, have to run...

Eventually I hope to have some better documentation, samples and unit tests.

Any questions, feel free to email me.

Enjoy!
